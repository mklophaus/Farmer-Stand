#The Farmer Stand

##Experience & Design
This project was made with Ruby on Rails, Javascript, jQuery, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. 

##MVP
This application works by having a user come in as a farmer or purchaser. A farmer has the ability to create his own products and update them to the database. A user can then add as many products as he/she likes to their order. A farmer is able to remove or edit the products. A user can also update their account.
